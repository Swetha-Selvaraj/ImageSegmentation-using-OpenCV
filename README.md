# Image Segmentation using OpenCV
This project demonstrates a real-time selfie segmentation application using the power of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing and [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for user-friendly interaction. It allows users to segment themselves from the background in real-time using their webcam.
